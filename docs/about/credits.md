- [Google Material Design Specification](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) - thank you for the effort to put forth a deeply researched, functional, and beautiful design standard.
- [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/) - thank you for your effort, we have drawn inspiration for certain components and examples directly from your codebase.
