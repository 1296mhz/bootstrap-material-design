Bootstrap Material Design
=========================

This Bootstrap theme is an easy way to use the new Material Design guide-lines by Google in your Bootstrap 3 based application.
Just include the theme right after the Bootstrap CSS and include the javascript at the end of your document, everything will be converted to Material Design (paper) style.

This theme is in early developement and is not ready for production.

# Documentation

Material Design for Bootstrap provides some additional stuff to get the best from Material Design.

### Buttons:

Add `.btn-flat` to a button to make it flat, without shadows.  
Add `.btn-raised` to a button to add a permanent shadow to it.

### Inputs:

Add `.floating-label` to an input field with a `placeholder` to transform the placeholder in a floating label.

Remember to use the proper HTML markup to get radio and checkboxes styled correctly (choose between *radio* or *checkbox*):

    <div class="radio/checkbox radio-primary">
        <label>
            <input type="radio/checkbox" checked>
            Option one is this
        </label>
    </div>


# Compatibility

Currently Material Design for Bootstrap supports only Google Chrome, my aim is to support Firefox, Internet Explorer 11, Safari and all major mobile browsers.
