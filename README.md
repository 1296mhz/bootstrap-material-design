# Documentation

Material Design for Bootstrap provides some additional stuff to get the best from Material Design.

### Variations:

There are 17 additional color variations (in addition to the classic 4 variations) for buttons, inputs, checkboxes, radios, alerts, navbars, tabs, labels, paginations, progess bars and more.  
They can be used adding to the desired element the class suffix `-material-color` replacing `color` with the desired one.

Example:

    <button class="btn btn-material-deeppurple">Deep purple button</button>

These colors are took from the Material Design color palette and are reported below:

### Buttons:

Add `.btn-flat` to a button to make it flat, without shadows.  
Add `.btn-raised` to a button to add a permanent shadow to it.

### Inputs:

Add `.floating-label` to an input field with a `placeholder` to transform the placeholder in a floating label.

Remember to use the proper HTML markup to get radio and checkboxes styled correctly (choose between *radio* or *checkbox*):

    <div class="radio/checkbox radio-primary">
        <label>
            <input type="radio/checkbox" checked>
            Option one is this
        </label>
    </div>
