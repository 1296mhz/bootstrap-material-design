Bootstrap Material Design
=========================

This Bootstrap theme is an easy way to use the new Material Design guide-lines by Google in your Bootstrap 3 based application.
Just include the theme right after the Bootstrap CSS and include the javascript at the end of your document, everything will be converted to Material Design (paper) style.

This theme is in early developement and is not ready for production.
